## Vocabulary

- **PDF** – Portable Document Format
    - Commonly used file format that can inlcude text, images, graphics, and interactive forms.
- **OCR** – Optical Character Recognition
    - The process of using a computer to extract text from an image.

### What are PDFs?  

* PDF (Portable Document Format) files are commonly used to create documents which can combine images, graphics, and text. 
* There are many types of PDFs.

### What is OCR?

* OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition. This is the process of using a computer to extract text from an image. Generally, this is done to PDFs, but OCR can be run on any image with typed text.
* OCR works best on standard type faces, but is not effective at identifying text from handwriting. 

### Good vs Bad PDFs

* Most PDFs that we OCR come from photos or scans of physical items. PDFs created digitally, including journal publications, have a text layer already built-in. We can check if a PDF already has text built-in by trying to copy/paste the text or by searching the PDF (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F).
* The quality of a scanned document has a great effect on the accuracy of the OCR. It's best to scan documents at high quality (600 dpi) and with good, overhead lighting. Book scanners are great for this job.
