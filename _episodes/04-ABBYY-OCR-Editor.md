### Working with Tables

Many PDFs include data in the form of tables. While recognizing the text and numbers in a table is straightforward, maintaing the table structure is more difficult. 

>## From PDF to Excel
>ABBYY can recognize the structure of data tables. It uses the lines seperating rows & columns to idenitify the data in each cell.
>
>1. In the ABBYY folder, right-click to open 'tables.pdf' in ABBYY FineReader.
>2. Click the 'Recognize Text' drop-down and select 'Open in OCR Editor'.
>3. ABBYY should recognize the tables in this PDF. ABBYY designates tables with blue shading.
>4. We can manually adjust columns and rows to match the table structure.
>5. Click 'Send to Excel', this will open the table in excel. We can edit or save the table from there.
