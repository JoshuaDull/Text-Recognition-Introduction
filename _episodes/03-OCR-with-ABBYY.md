    * Straightening & de-skewing text
    * Removing noise or extraneous marks

### Viewing OCR output

* After the OCR process is complete, we can compare the original document to the text-only version.
* ABBYY highlights potential errors in blue. We can manually correct or edit the text data before saving/exporting for greater QA.

- Spend a few minutes manually correcting and verifying highlighted text. 

### Creating an Area Template

- Click on main block of text (green box) and expand it to fill the entire desired area.
- Save this as template
- Apply this template to the other pages. 

### Using the image editor

* ABBYY provides a built-in image editor to correct scans increasing the legibility of the text. 
* The default option will try to intellegently correct the image so the OCR engine can more easily recognize text. You can also edit the scans manually. 

- White background
- More contrast
- de-skew words/lines
- Remove noise & marks

* Edits can be done on single pages or applied to all pages.
